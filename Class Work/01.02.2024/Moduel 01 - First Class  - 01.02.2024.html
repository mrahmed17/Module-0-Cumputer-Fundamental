	</head>
		<body>
			<p> Malaysia based BNG Global Holding could not start the work of Jhilmil Residential Park Project in Keraniganj although six years have gone by since a deal was struck in this end. Yet, the consortium has sought permission from Rajuk to take a questionable loan of USD 600 million for the project. Under this circumstance, the stakeholders suggested the residential project should not be implemented by the BNG Global Holdings. The capacity of the BNG Global to complete the project has been questioned by a primary investigation report prepared by the Bangladesh High Commission in Malaysia.</p>
			<p> Rajuk signed a public-private partnership (PPP) deal with BNG Global Holdings on 16 November in 2017 to develop the project site at the outskirts of Dhaka.</p>
